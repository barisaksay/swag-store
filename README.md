# Test Automation w/Cypress - SauceLabs Demo Store


This repository contains a test automation project built using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and JavaScript. The project follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern and includes UI end-to-end (e2e) tests.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to automate the testing of demo website (saucelabs demo store:https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/) by simulating user interactions and verifying application behavior. 

## The key technologies and design patterns used in this project are:

- **Cypress**: A powerful, fast, and reliable testing framework for anything that runs in a browser.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used to write the test scripts.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: A design pattern used to create an object repository for web elements, making test scripts more readable, maintainable, and reusable.
- **UI e2e Tests**: End-to-end tests that cover the full user journey across the application, ensuring all components work together as expected.
